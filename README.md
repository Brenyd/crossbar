# Crossbar — prototype 0.2

An Arch-based live distro that boots straight into a console-style cross-media-bar shell:
flowing month-coloured waves, categories across, items down, folders, a △-style options
panel, and gamepad control.

Categories, in the original order: **Users · Settings · Photo · Music · Video ·
TV & Video Services · Game · Network · Store · Party**. One Game list merges Steam, GOG and
Epic; Store downloads from all three; Music plays your files and Spotify; Video plays
anything mpv can, with a controller-friendly control panel.

## Run it

**Full install guide (virt-manager and bare metal): [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)**

**Quickest — on your current desktop, no ISO (demo library):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Brenyd/crossbar.git && cd crossbar
./dev-run.sh            # opens the shell in a Chromium app window
./dev-run.sh --real     # use your real accounts (needs steam / legendary installed)
```

**Build the ISO** (on Arch or CachyOS; needs ~15 GB free and downloads ~3 GB):

```bash
./build-iso.sh          # -> out/crossbar-YYYY.MM.DD-x86_64.iso
./build-in-docker.sh    # same, from any distro with Docker or Podman
```

**Boot it in a VM:**

```bash
./run-vm.sh                     # QEMU/KVM, virgl 3D, 8 GB RAM, 64 GB games disk
NOGL=1 ./run-vm.sh              # if the window is black (no virgl on your host)
PAD=054c:0ce6 ./run-vm.sh       # pass a USB controller through (ids from `lsusb`)
```

To install permanently, open **Settings › Install to Disk** from the live system
(UEFI only, erases the chosen disk). See [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Controls

| Action | Keyboard | Gamepad |
|---|---|---|
| Move | Arrow keys | D-pad / left stick |
| Enter | Enter | A / ✕ |
| Back | Esc | B / ○ |
| Options | Tab | Y / △ |
| Back to the XMB from a game, video or Discord | Super+Esc | Guide / PS button |
| Terminal (debugging) | Ctrl+Alt+T | |

**While a video plays** (panel hidden): A pause · ◀/▶ seek −10 s/+30 s · ▲/▼ volume ·
L1/R1 previous/next · Y show panel · B jump to Stop. With the panel open, ◀/▶ pick a
button (previous, rewind, play/pause, forward, next, subtitles, audio track, stop), A presses
it, B hides it. Videos resume where you stopped (toggle in Settings › Media Settings).

**Photo viewer:** ◀/▶ browse · A slideshow · Y hide captions · B back.

## Music, Video, Photo

Pick your library folders in **Settings › Media Settings** (defaults `~/Music`, `~/Videos`,
`~/Pictures`; any drive under `/run/media` or `/mnt` works). Browse by folder, or use
**All Songs / All Videos**.

- **Music** plays through a hidden mpv and keeps going while you browse or play games.
  *Now Playing* sits at the top of Music; A pauses, Y gives next/previous/shuffle/repeat/stop.
  Tags and album art come from the files (or a `cover.jpg` in the folder).
- **Video** opens mpv full screen with Crossbar's own control panel. Home pauses it and
  returns to the XMB; *Return to…* at the top of Video picks it back up.
- **Photo** shows thumbnails, a full-screen viewer and slideshows.
- **TV & Video Services** opens web apps in their own window: YouTube (its TV interface,
  made for controllers), Twitch, Plex, plus anything you add (Jellyfin, etc.).

## Spotify

Crossbar becomes a **Spotify Connect speaker named "Crossbar"** (via librespot), and the
Music › Spotify folder browses your Liked Songs and playlists, searches, and plays them on
it, with a Now Playing item and controls like local music. You can also start music on your
phone and move it to Crossbar with **Play on Crossbar**.

Spotify's rules (since February 2026) mean a one-time setup:

1. You need **Spotify Premium** (Connect playback and developer apps both require it).
2. On any device, open [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard), **Create app**.
   Redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:7777/spotify/callback`. Tick **Web API**. Save.
3. On Crossbar: **Music › Spotify › Set Up Spotify**, paste the **Client ID**, sign in once in
   the window that opens (and allow access). Press Home if the window doesn't close itself.

After that it just works, every boot. Developer-mode apps allow up to 5 accounts; playlists
you don't own can be played but their track list can't be shown (a Spotify restriction).

## Settings

| Section | What's in it |
|---|---|
| Display | Resolution, refresh rate, scale per screen; new modes auto-revert after 15 s unless you choose Keep |
| Sound | Output device, input (mic) device, volumes, menu sounds |
| Theme | Background colour, or automatic by month |
| Media | Music / Video / Photo folders, resume videos, subtitles default |
| Network | Connection status, Wi-Fi scan and connect |
| Accounts | User name, Spotify |
| System | Demo library, system information, install to disk |

## How the stores connect

Starts in **demo mode** with sample games so everything is clickable. Turn it off in
Settings › Demo Library, then sign in from Store.

| Store | Sign-in | Downloads | Launch |
|---|---|---|---|
| Steam | SteamID64 + Web API key lists your library; the Steam client signs in on first install | Steam client (`steam://install`), progress read from its appmanifest files | `steam://rungameid` |
| GOG | Official GOG sign-in page in a web view (same OAuth flow Minigalaxy/Heroic use) | Native Linux installers via GOG's API | `start.sh` |
| Epic | Epic sign-in page in a web view → `legendary auth` | `legendary install`, live progress | `legendary launch` (Wine) |

Everything lives under `~/Games`, which in the VM is the 64 GB `games.qcow2` disk. Steam,
legendary and Crossbar settings are kept there too, so they survive reboots of the live ISO.

## Party chat

Pick a voice service (Discord app or web, Mumble, TeamSpeak, Element), hit **Start Party**, and
press Home to come back to the XMB while voice keeps running. **Quick Join** stores channel
links (paste a `discord.com/channels/…` link and it opens in the Discord app).

## Layout

```
shell/server.py               backend: JSON API + serves the UI (stdlib only)
shell/crossbar/providers/     steam.py, gog.py, epic.py, demo.py
shell/crossbar/system.py      sway windows, gamepad daemon, audio devices, Wi-Fi, power
shell/crossbar/media.py       library folders, tags, thumbnails, folder picker
shell/crossbar/player.py      mpv music (hidden) and video (full screen) over IPC
shell/crossbar/spotify.py     librespot Connect speaker + Spotify Web API
shell/crossbar/display.py     resolution / refresh / scale via sway
shell/crossbar/party.py       voice services + channels
shell/mpv/crossbar-osc.lua    the controller-friendly video control panel
shell/crossbar/login_helper.py  web-view window for GOG/Epic sign-in
shell/web/                    the XMB: xmb.js (core), media.js (Photo/Music/Video/TV/Network), settings.js
iso/                          archiso overlay: packages, autologin, sway session, boot setup
```

Boot path: autologin `player` on tty1 → sway (tabbed, so one app is visible at a time) →
`crossbar-shell` starts the backend and a kiosk Chromium window → the XMB.

## Known gaps (next steps)

- GOG Windows-only games and Epic games run through plain Wine; Proton/umu integration is next.
- Steam owned-games listing needs a Web API key; a QR/password login through the client would be smoother.
- No on-screen keyboard yet — text fields (Wi-Fi password, Spotify Client ID, search) need a physical keyboard.
- Netflix/Disney+/Spotify's web player need Widevine DRM, which Arch's Chromium doesn't ship.
- In the YouTube TV interface the controller works only if the site picks it up; arrow keys always work.
- The installer erases the whole disk (no dual-boot), and NVIDIA drivers aren't included yet.
- Party is a launcher, not an in-game overlay (Discord's API doesn't allow a third-party voice UI).
